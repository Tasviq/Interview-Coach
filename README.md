# Interview Coach
An interactive interview simulator that initiates an interview based on the user's preference of style: behavioural, conceptual, or technical. A webcam along with speech audio mimics a real-life interview for users to practice.

## Menu
The landing page is a modern user interface that allows user to select their style and number of interview questions.

## Interview
Once launched, the interview simulator begins asking its questions while the user's webcam is turned on, if preferred.
